 Remote Secure Shell Sessions
######################################

.. Note::
   Throughout these instructions, replace **HOSTNAME**, **DOMAIN**, and 
   **TLD** with the name of the computer to be accessed, the domain for the 
   computer, and the top-level domain (.com, .net, etc.). For example, 
   **HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD** might be replaced with **workserver.github.com** 
   for the work server at GitHub.

Understanding SSH keys
=============================

.. sidebar:: Credentials Index
  
  Each workstation or server in a network should have a unique computer name, 
  and users on a system should have their own usernames. On this premise, the 
  combined computername/username should be unique or uncommonly duplicated 
  across a computer network. This makes credential management more transparent.

SSH is a free, open-source public key credential and encryption system which 
forms the basis for secure communication on Internet Protocol networks. SSH 
credential keys are indexed to the combination of computername/username, as 
mentioned in the sidebar. This permits authorizing system access while offering 
a mechanism to reject credentials for specific computername/usernames, as when 
a computer is stolen. 

Configuring SSH for a user
=============================

Each user should create a key set with the command::

  if [ ! -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ]; then ssh-keygen -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa; fi

Resulting keys are stored in the files

+ private key: :file:`~/.ssh/id_rsa`
+ public key:  :file:`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
+ known hosts: :file:`~/.ssh/known_hosts`

List the hidden :file:`.ssh` directory to see the permissions::

  ls -al ~/.ssh

Recommended configuration
-----------------------------

On each computer, comment out the line :command:`HashKnownHosts yes` in file 
:file:`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` with the following command::

  sudo sed -i "s/    HashKnown/#   HashKnown/" /etc/ssh/ssh_config

Using SSH in web browsers
-----------------------------

PuTTY is an open-source cross-platform client for secure connections with 
remote hosts. It is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and it is the 
preferred client on Windows. PuTTY adds power to interactive sessions. For 
example, a user can add a port forwarding rule within a running terminal 
session.

For a KDE desktop system derived from Debian, replace :command:`ssh` with 
:command:`PuTTY` as the default :command:`ssh\://` handler for your browser with 
the following command (courtesy of VonGrippen, AKA Michael Cochran)::

   bash < <(wget http://git.io/kde-putty -O-)

Alternatively, click :download:`this download link <_downloads/putty-kde.sh>` 
to download the script file and run it with the command::

  sudo bash putty-kde.sh
 
Test this configuration in your browser by going to the link address::

   ssh://github.com

.. note::
  Firefox requires you to type in the program name to handle ssh, 
  :command:`xdg-open`. Google Chrome's omnisearch box is a serious hindrance 
  with ssh links, but will work. GitHub will not log you in over ssh, of 
  course.

Press :kbd:`<Ctrl-RightClick>` to change PuTTY settings in a running session. 
Make changes permanent by saving :menuselection:`Session --> Default Settings`. 

Commands to install keys
-----------------------------

Where a user has login privileges on a system, add an ssh key to the remote 
system for secure access with the command::

  ssh-copy-id `id -un`@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

replacing HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD with the computer's fully qualified domain name.

Secure web services
-----------------------------

Many web services which require ssh keys, such as GitHub, install keys through 
cut-and-paste. Display a user's local public key using the command::

  kate ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

In Kate, press :kbd:`<Ctrl-A><Ctrl-C>` to copy, and paste the key to the web 
page with :kbd:`<Ctrl-V>`.

Managing Changed SSH Keys
=============================

An :command:`ssh` session may abort when starting. The most likely cause for 
this is a changed ssh key on either the local or the remote system. Address 
this problem in a console session. When a new key is created on the local 
system, copy the key to the remote system with the :command:`ssh-copy-id` 
command as described above. 

If a remote system key is changed, connect to the remote system with::

  ssh `id -un`@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

A console message will identify the line number in :file:`~/.ssh/known_hosts` 
file which contains an invalid key. Delete this line with the command::

  sed -i '[linenumber]d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts

where the expression ``[linenumber]`` is replaced with a line number.

Then reconnect from the console, and save the new key when prompted.

Remote logins over ssh
=============================

Basic:
-----------------------------

From a console session, login to a remote system with the command::

	ssh `id -un`@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD


Port forwarding for RDP:
-----------------------------

::

	ssh -L3389:[remoteIP]:3389 [username]@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

Display the forwarded :command:`RDP` session in :command:`Remmina` or 
:command:`KRDC`.

Gnome terminal
-----------------------------

NX performing X-11 Forwarding with gnome-terminal::

	gnome-terminal -x ssh -L8889:localhost:8888 [username]@HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.TLD

KDE PuTTY
-----------------------------

Select :menuselection:`Applications --> Internet --> PuTTY SSH Client` from the 
menu.
